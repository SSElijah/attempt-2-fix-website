            <h1>Bidoof</h1>
            <p>Based off of tons of research, this result may shock you...</p>

                <h2>What the heck is even that?</h2>
                <p>Alright, hear me out. This companion will change your life for the better. Have you ever been
                    attacked by
                    intruders? Have you ever felt threatened? Fear no more, your savior is here. This companions's name
                    is
                    Bidoof,
                    which kind of resembles a rodent due to its dark brown snout, red nose, and bushy cheeks. It also
                    has 2
                    large teeth/incisors on its upper jaw used for gnawing wood and rocks. Why get a chainsaw when you
                    can
                    get a Bidoof? Unlike dogs, this companion can be found and tamed in the wild, near small bodies of
                    water,
                    around lakes or rivers. They tend to build dams, so as long as you wait outside their natural
                    habitat,
                    you have a chance to recruit your own Bidoof!</p>

                <h2>Bibarel</h2>
                <p> Now here's what's crazy, unlike other companions, this little guy <strong>evolves.</strong> Say
                    Bidoof is a level 1 crook,
                    this
                    little fella is now a level 50 boss. Once you feed your companion enough, it'll become a Bibarel.
                    This upgraded
                    companion
                    can not only cut down trees but also <strong>build</strong> structures. So when you grow old and
                    can't build a fire,
                    Bibarel will assist you by bringing all the wood in a pile. Overall, Bidoof would make a great
                    companion for those who live in the woods due to its expertiese in the forest environment. Who
                    wouldn't want a Bidoof/Bibarel as a
                    companion?</p>
