                <h2>What does it mean to have loyalty?</h2>
                <p>Loyalty can be an allegiance and/or support towards someone or something. This is a form of
                    commitment and trust. It involves aiding something through their struggles or challenges and remains
                    dedicated even in the most stressful or difficult times. Loyalty is built on respect and
                    responsibility.</p>

                <h2>What does it mean to have power?</h2>
                <p>Having power means having the capacity to influence or control others and outcomes. It involves the
                    ability to make decisions and create change. Power can come from various sources, such as authority,
                    expertise, or resources, in this case, magic stones. It often requires responsibility and logical
                    consideration, as its impact can significantly affect individuals and situations. Ultimately, power
                    is one's ability to make an impact and create events according to one's will or goals.</p>

                <h2>What does it mean to have companionship?</h2>
                <p>Companionship means having a supportive relationship with another person or group, based on
                    understanding and trust. It involves spending time together, offering support, and enjoying each
                    other's presence. Companionship provides a sense of connection which influences later events in your
                    life. Companionship is a genuine commitment to each other's well-being, making life's journey more
                    meaningful and fulfilling.</p>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <p>Due to all of the information we know along with logic and reasoning, I have come to the conclusion that
                Thanos is the ultimate companion. In life we face hardships, loneliness, and sadness. We are vulnerable,
                working hard, and leveling up through our experiences in life. Thinking back to the idea of companion,
                what would be my top pick that I think would influence my life the most? A dog and Bidoof is cool and
                all but the difference between those 2 and Thanos is the fact that Thanos has the infinity gauntlet. All
                he has to do is snap his fingers and all of my problems will go away. If that's not peak companionship,
                I don't know what is.</p>
