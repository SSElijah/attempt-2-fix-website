                <h2>What do dogs do?</h2>
                <p>Dogs are animals that thrive off of companionship. They enjoy running, playing, exploring, and
                    meeting other dogs or people. Dogs are can protect their owner depending on the breed and how they
                    are trained. In general though, dogs bark a lot so they are kind of like a walking security system.
                    They also have a strong sense of smell so when you're trying to watch the game eating a sandwich,
                    you'll have a free footrest depending on where your dog sits and when they give up trying to get a
                    bite of your sandwich. Overall, dogs are such wonderful creatures that will always being happiness
                    to your life and the world in general.</p>
